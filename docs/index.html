    <h3>The <s>EASY</s> <strong>HARD</strong> way to make a website.</h3>
    <h2><strong>BUT IT IS FREE</strong></h2>

Sure, using a website builder might seem like a good idea—just like microwaving instant ramen seems like "cooking." But if you've ever wanted your digital presence to scream                       anything other than “I used the same template as Brenda’s cat grooming blog,” then coding your own website is the way to go. Think of it like baking your own bread—except instead of flour and yeast, you’re kneading HTML, CSS, and the occasional existential crisis. </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
When you build it yourself, you control everything: the design, the features, the speed, the color of the buttons that users will definitely never click. Want a homepage that sings "Eye of the Tiger" on hover? You got it. Need an animated GIF of your face spinning in a circle while listing your services? Nobody’s stopping you. The world is your (slightly buggy but lovingly crafted) oyster. </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
And let’s not forget the thrill of debugging your own code at 2 a.m., muttering to yourself like a wizard with a broken spellbook. That’s character development. Compare that to using a website builder, where you're locked in a digital IKEA showroom, endlessly dragging boxes around and hoping your "vision" fits their idea of a contact form. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
So go ahead—code your website. It might not be perfect, but at least it won't have an auto-generated footer that says "Proudly powered by GenericSiteBuilderPro3000." You deserve  better. Your cat’s blog deserves better. Let’s build something real.

    <p>
HTML is basically the skeleton of every website — the bare bones. It’s like the person at a party who shows up early to set up the chairs and tables. Not glamorous, but absolutely necessary. Without HTML, you’d just be staring at a blank screen wondering if your Wi-Fi is broken. It tells the browser what stuff is supposed to be on the page — like “Here's a heading,” “This is some text,” or “Yes, we definitely need that dancing banana GIF front and center.” It's not flashy, but it keeps the party organized.
    </p>
    <br>

CSS, on the other hand, is the stylish friend who comes in after HTML and says, “Okay, but let’s make this place look fabulous.” It picks out the fonts, sets the color scheme, and rearranges everything so it looks like someone actually tried. Want your text pink and floating gently across the screen? CSS says, “Say no more.” Without CSS, your beautifully structured HTML page would look like it was designed by a robot from the 90s who just discovered Times New Roman.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
JavaScript is the life of the party — the one doing backflips, telling jokes, and making the lights flash in rhythm with the music. It's responsible for everything interactive and dynamic on the page. Clicking buttons, sliders that slide, pop-ups (love ‘em or hate ‘em), and even chatbots like me? That’s JavaScript showing off. It can literally change the page as you're using it — like a magician pulling content out of a hat.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
Put all three together and you’ve got the ultimate web trio. HTML sets the stage, CSS brings the style, and JavaScript steals the show. Without one, things just feel… off. It’s like a band missing a member: HTML alone is a garage band with no amps, CSS without structure is a fashion show in an empty room, and JavaScript without the other two is just an energetic person jumping around with no audience. But together? They make internet magic.
