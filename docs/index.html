    <h1>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h1>
    <h3>The <s>EASY</s> <strong>HARD</strong> way to make a website.</h3>
    <h2><strong>BUT IT IS FREE</strong></h2>
    <hr align="center" width="75%" height="10px">
    <br>
<p>
    Sure, using a website builder <em>feels</em> like a good idea—kind of like microwaving ramen and calling it "cooking." 
    It technically works, but if you want your website to scream something other than “I used the same template as Brenda’s 
    blog about her hairless cats,” then it’s time to roll up your sleeves and code. Think of it like baking your own bread—
    from scratch—with HTML, CSS, and a generous pinch of frustration.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    When you code it yourself, you’re the boss. You choose the layout, the animations, the shade of neon green that will burn into 
    visitors' retinas. Want a homepage that plays the Pokémon theme song on hover? Go wild. Dreaming of a spinning GIF of your head 
    announcing your services like a carnival barker? Who’s stopping you? This is your beautifully glitchy, one-of-a-kind masterpiece.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    And then there’s the 2 a.m. debugging session. You, in pajamas, whispering incantations to your laptop like a sleep-deprived wizard 
    trying to summon a missing semicolon. That’s not just coding—that’s character building. Compare that to using a site builder, where 
    you’re basically trapped in digital IKEA: dragging pre-made boxes around, trying to jam your weird and wonderful vision into a 
    soulless template labeled “Modern Business.”
</p>
<br>

<p>
    So yeah—go ahead and build it yourself. It might not be perfect, but it’ll be <strong>yours</strong>. No default footers saying 
    “Proudly powered by MyFirstWebsite123.” You deserve better. Your <em>cat’s</em> blog deserves better. Let’s make something real.

<h3>Three Languages</h3>

<p>
    HTML is the skeleton of the web—it’s the quiet early bird at the party setting up chairs. Not glamorous, but without it? 
    You’ve just got a blank screen and sadness. It tells your browser what to show: “Here’s a heading,” “That’s a paragraph,” 
    “And yes, this page <em>does</em> need a dancing banana GIF front and center.” HTML doesn’t show off. It shows <em>up</em>.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Then CSS shows up like the fashionable friend who kicks open the door and says, “Okay but… let’s make this fabulous.” 
    It handles the fonts, colors, layout—all the good stuff that makes your page look like someone actually cared. You want 
    rainbow text that bounces like a trampoline? CSS is like, “Honey, I got you.” Without CSS, even the best HTML page looks 
    like it came from a 1998 school project.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Enter JavaScript: the life of the party. It’s juggling, cracking jokes, flipping switches, and making the lights flash in 
    sync with the music. Buttons that actually do something? JavaScript. Pop-ups (ugh), image sliders, real-time chatbots—yup, 
    all JavaScript. It brings your site to life, sometimes too much life, like that one friend who’s had too much coffee but 
    you secretly love them for it.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Put them all together and you’ve got the dream team. HTML builds the bones, CSS dresses it up, and JavaScript brings the fun. 
    On their own? Kinda awkward. But together? They’re internet magic. Like a band that actually practices, or a pizza with the 
    perfect crust, cheese, and toppings. Don’t skip any of them—they each bring the flavor.

<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>
    HTML tags are like little theater kids in angle brackets—always announcing their entrance. 
    “<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> I’m a paragraph!” they shout, before dramatically exiting with 
    <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. They travel in pairs like clingy twins—one opens, one closes, and in between is 
    your content just trying to live its best life. Put them together and you’ve got an <strong>element</strong>, 
    which is just a fancy word for a tag sandwich.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    But some tags are rebels. Take <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for example—shows up, drops a picture, and struts off 
    without saying goodbye. Or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, who literally just yells “Line break!” and vanishes. 
    HTML is full of these quirky characters, each with their own little jobs, all yelling at your browser to make 
    the web behave.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Think of HTML tags as the internet’s way of yelling instructions in a passive-aggressive hug. Wrapped in 
    <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, these little commands tell the browser, “This is a heading now,” or “Make this look like a link.” 
    It’s like labeling your lunch in the office fridge—except the fridge listens, and your sandwich turns into a button.
</p>
<p>
    For exemple type in:
    <br>
    <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    will show this in your website:
    
</p>
    <br>
</body>
